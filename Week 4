In my project I will be looking at a new potential location for a restaurant in Toronto. I will be analysing the area to identify the most popular restaurants and identify a gap in the market. If the area is saturated with too much of a cuisine then it will be tough for a new restaurant to survive, therefore we will be deciding what cuisine after analysing the data.
This would be helpful to anyone who wants to open a restaurants in future as this document will analyse the area and the restaurant market providing information on competitions.



The information for Toronto was obtained through the Wikipedia, which we scraped through and built a data frame. I will clean it and use Foursquare location data to obtain the latitude and longitude for each point.
